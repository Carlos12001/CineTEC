/* The code is defining an interface named `Projection`. An interface in TypeScript is a way to define the structure of an object. In this case, the `Projection` interface has four properties: `id`, `horary`, `roomid`, and `movieid`, all of which are of type `string`. This interface can be used to define objects that have these properties and their corresponding types. The `export` keyword is used to make the interface accessible outside of the current module. */
export interface Projection {
  id: string;
  horary: string;
